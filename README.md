 multi-agent q-learning integration tests

# Running the Code:
Install PettingZoo and its dependencies (pip install pettingzoo[classic]).
Copy the script into a Python file (e.g., multi_agent_q_learning.py).
Run the script in your Python environment.
This script sets up a basic Q-learning framework for three agents in the simple_spread environment from PettingZoo. Each agent has its own Q-table and learns independently based on its experiences and rewards. The agents' actions are decided either randomly (exploration) or by choosing the best-known action from the Q-table (exploitation).
